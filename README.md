# Traffic Light Simulation and Analysis

This project simulates and analyzes traffic light patterns for urban intersections using **SimPy** and visualizes the data with **Matplotlib**. The simulation aims to evaluate traffic flow, waiting times, and queue lengths, helping optimize traffic light timings for better efficiency.

## Features

- **Simulates Traffic Lights**: Models green, yellow, and red light cycles.
- **Car Traffic Simulation**: Cars arrive at the intersection following a Poisson distribution.
- **Data Collection**: Tracks waiting times, queue lengths, and cars passed.
- **Visualization**: Creates charts to analyze traffic behavior.

## Technologies Used

- [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/): Event-driven process-based simulation framework.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Data visualization library.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-light-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd traffic-light-simulation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install simpy matplotlib
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python traffic_simulation.py
   ```
2. View the output:
   - The console will display average waiting time, maximum waiting time, and the number of cars that passed the intersection.
   - Visual charts will pop up showing traffic metrics.

---

## Visualizations

The following charts are generated by the simulation:

1. **Waiting Time Distribution**: Histogram of waiting times for cars.
2. **Cumulative Cars Passed Over Time**: Line chart showing the total number of cars passed as time progresses.
3. **Traffic Light States Over Time**: Scatter plot showing the green, yellow, and red light states.
4. **Queue Length Over Time**: Line chart illustrating how the queue length changes.

## Example Output

### Simulation Results
```
Average waiting time: 30.25 seconds
Maximum waiting time: 90.45 seconds
Number of cars passed: 1200
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple intersections.
- Include pedestrian crossing simulations.
- Optimize traffic light timing dynamically based on queue length.
